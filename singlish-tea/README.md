## Prisma

To view and manage your database with Prisma Studio, run:

```sh
npx prisma studio
```

Make sure your database server (e.g., PostgreSQL) is running before running migrations, seeding, or starting the app.
# Singlish Showdown

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm (project is configured for npm)
- PostgreSQL (or your configured Prisma database)



## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Recommended: Docker Compose)

The fastest way to run everything (app + PostgreSQL) is with Docker Compose. This handles all dependencies and setup for you.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `singlish-tea/` and fill in your values. Set `DATABASE_URL` to:
   ```
   postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/singlish_showdown
   ```
2. Start everything (from the project root):
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

To stop and remove containers:
```sh
docker-compose down
```

All migrations and seeding are handled automatically by the app container on first run. No need to run manual setup steps unless you want to.

---

## Dockerfile (App Only)

The app can be built and run in a container using the provided `Dockerfile` in `singlish-tea/`. For Vercel deployment, you must use an external PostgreSQL provider (Vercel does not host databases).

## Deploying to Vercel

- Deploy only the Next.js app to Vercel (do not deploy the database).
- Use a managed PostgreSQL provider (e.g., Supabase, Neon, Railway, or similar).
- Set your production `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel's environment variables.


## Manual Setup (Advanced/Optional)

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run everything manually:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database and secret values.

3. **Start PostgreSQL:**
   - Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and matches your `.env` config.

4. **Prepare the database:**
   - Run Prisma migrations:
     ```sh
     npx prisma migrate dev
     ```
   - Seed the database with quiz questions:
     ```sh
     cd prisma/seed
     npx ts-node seed-questions.ts
     ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Notes

- Make sure your database is running before starting the app.
- For production, set up environment variables and run `npm run build` then `npm start`.
