# User Story 3: Content Authenticity and Review (Further Improved)

## As a content reviewer (Cultural Consultant),
I want to review and approve all questions, answers, and audio for cultural accuracy and authenticity,
So that the game content is respectful, accurate, and engaging.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- All questions, answers, and audio are reviewed and approved by at least one designated cultural consultant before being published.
- The review process is managed in an admin interface, with reviewer roles, approval status, and timestamps visible for each item.
- Stereotypes, inaccuracies, and insensitive content are flagged, discussed, and revised before release, with a comment system for reviewers.
- Explanations include relevant cultural context and are reviewed for clarity, accuracy, and educational value.
- All changes, reviews, and reviewer comments are logged for accountability, versioning, and audit trails.
- The system supports multiple reviewers and tracks consensus or disagreements for transparent decision-making.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on review times, flagged content, and reviewer actions to improve the review process (with privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for the review workflow (e.g., failed submissions, permission errors), with clear, user-friendly messages and options to retry or escalate.
- Review errors and unusual events are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
