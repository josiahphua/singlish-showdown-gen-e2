# User Story 8: Responsive Design (Further Improved)

## As a mobile or desktop user,
I want the game to work well and look great on any device,
So that I can play comfortably anywhere.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The UI adapts responsively to different screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions (minimum 320px width supported), using fluid layouts and scalable assets.
- Both touch and mouse interactions are fully supported and tested, with appropriate hit areas and gestures.
- Layout, text, and controls remain clear, usable, and visually appealing on all devices (phones, tablets, desktops), with no horizontal scrolling required.
- The game is tested on major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux) for consistent experience.
- The UI supports dark mode and adapts to system preferences.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on device/browser usage, screen sizes, and layout issues to inform responsive design improvements (with user consent and privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for layout/rendering issues (e.g., unsupported browsers, failed asset loads), with clear, user-friendly messages and fallback options.
- Responsive design errors and unusual events are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
