## As a player,
I want to answer a variety of trivia questions about Singlish words, phrases, and their meanings,
So that I can test and improve my knowledge of Singlish in a fun and interactive way.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The game presents a randomized series of multiple-choice questions about Singlish, with 3-4 answer options each.
- Questions are drawn from a large, categorized pool (by topic, difficulty, and type) to minimize repetition within and across sessions.
- Each question may include optional media (audio, image, or context sentence) to enhance engagement.
- Players receive immediate, clear feedback after each answer, including explanations, the correct answer, and a brief cultural note if relevant.
- The game tracks the player's score, progress, streaks, and time taken per question within a session.
- A visible timer is available for each question, with configurable time limits and a pause/resume feature for accessibility.
- The game supports both single-player and competitive (timed or scored) modes, with clear instructions for each.

- All question and answer text is reviewed for clarity, cultural sensitivity, and language accuracy.
- The game provides a summary screen at the end of each session, showing performance, correct/incorrect answers, and learning tips.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on question difficulty, common mistakes, time spent per question, and player engagement to inform future improvements (with user consent and privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for all user actions (e.g., network failures, invalid answers, session timeouts), with clear, user-friendly messages and options to retry or recover.
- The game logs errors and unusual events for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
