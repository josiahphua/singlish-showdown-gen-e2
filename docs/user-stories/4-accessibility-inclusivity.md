# User Story 4: Accessibility and Inclusivity (Further Improved)

## As a player with accessibility needs,
I want the game to be easy to read, navigate, and interact with regardless of my abilities,
So that I can enjoy the experience fully.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The game meets or exceeds WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, including ARIA practices and semantic HTML.
- High-contrast color schemes (minimum 4.5:1 ratio) and readable, scalable fonts are used throughout.
- All audio content is accompanied by accurate text transcripts and synchronized captions.
- The game is fully navigable via keyboard, with logical tab order and visible focus indicators.
- All interactive elements have accessible labels, roles, and states for screen readers.
- Explanations and glossaries are available for unfamiliar terms, with easy access from any question or feedback screen.
- The UI supports zoom, prefers-reduced-motion, and other user accessibility settings.
- Accessibility is tested with real users and automated tools before each release.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on accessibility feature usage (e.g., screen reader, captions, high contrast mode) to inform future improvements (with user consent and privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for accessibility features (e.g., failed transcript loads, navigation issues), with clear, user-friendly messages and fallback options.
- Accessibility-related errors and unusual events are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
