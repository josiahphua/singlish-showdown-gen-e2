# User Story 7: Modular Codebase (Further Improved)

## As a developer,
I want the codebase to be modular, maintainable, and well-documented,
So that new features and content can be added, tested, and maintained easily.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The codebase is organized by clear feature modules (quiz, audio, leaderboard, admin, etc.), with minimal cross-dependencies and clear folder structure.
- Each module includes clear documentation (README or doc comments) describing its purpose, API, usage, and dependencies.
- Unit and integration tests are included for all modules, with at least 90% coverage, and tests are run automatically in CI.
- Module boundaries are enforced by code review, static analysis tools, and linting rules.
- New features are added as new modules or extensions to existing ones, following established patterns and reviewed for maintainability.
- The codebase includes onboarding documentation for new contributors and a changelog for major updates.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on module usage, feature adoption, and error rates to inform refactoring and future development (with privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for module boundaries (e.g., import errors, dependency issues), with clear, developer-friendly messages and logging.
- Build and runtime errors are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
