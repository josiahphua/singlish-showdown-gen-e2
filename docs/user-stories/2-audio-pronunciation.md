# User Story 2: Audio Pronunciation (Further Improved)

## As a player,
I want to hear high-quality audio clips of Singlish words and phrases in each question,
So that I can learn the correct pronunciation and usage.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Each relevant question includes an audio clip, recorded by a native speaker or using high-quality TTS, with preference for authentic local accents.
- Audio files are in a standard format (e.g., MP3, WAV), optimized for web playback and fast loading.
- Players can replay the audio as needed, with accessible controls and visual feedback for play/pause.
- If audio is unavailable, a clear message or fallback is provided, and the question remains answerable.
- All audio content is reviewed for authenticity, clarity, and cultural appropriateness.
- Audio controls are accessible via keyboard and screen readers (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant), with transcripts available for all clips.
- Audio volume and playback speed can be adjusted by the user for accessibility.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on audio usage (e.g., replay count, playback speed adjustments, audio-related errors) to improve future content and accessibility (with user consent and privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for audio playback issues (e.g., failed loads, unsupported formats), with clear, user-friendly messages and fallback options.
- Audio errors and unusual events are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
