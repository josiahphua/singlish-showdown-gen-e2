# User Story 10: Progress Tracking (Further Improved)

## As a returning player,
I want to track my progress and see which questions Iâ€™ve answered,
So that I can improve over time, avoid repetition, and measure my learning.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The game saves player progress and history, either locally, in the cloud, or tied to a user account (configurable), with clear privacy options.
- Previously answered questions are not repeated in the same session, and can be filtered out in future sessions; players can reset or review their history.
- Players can review their past answers, explanations, and performance statistics at any time, with visualizations (e.g., charts, streaks).
- Progress data is retained for a configurable period (e.g., 6 months) and can be exported, downloaded, or deleted by the user at any time.
- Returning players are prompted to resume or start a new session based on saved progress, with clear options and explanations.
- The system supports syncing progress across devices if the player is logged in.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on progress tracking usage, session resumes, and data exports/deletions to inform future improvements (with user consent and privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for progress tracking actions (e.g., failed saves, sync errors, data loss), with clear, user-friendly messages and options to retry or recover.
- Progress tracking errors and unusual events are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
