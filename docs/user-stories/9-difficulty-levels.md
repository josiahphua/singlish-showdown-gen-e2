# User Story 9: Difficulty Levels (Further Improved)

## As a player,
I want to choose the difficulty level of the questions,
So that the game matches my knowledge and skill and provides an appropriate challenge.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Players can select from at least three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) before starting a session, with descriptions of what to expect at each level.
- Question pools are categorized and tagged by difficulty, with clear, documented criteria for each level (e.g., vocabulary complexity, context required).
- Scores and rewards scale with the chosen difficulty (e.g., more points for harder questions), and are explained to the player.
- The game may offer adaptive difficulty, increasing or decreasing based on player performance, with the option to opt out.
- Players can view their performance by difficulty level in their progress history, with suggestions for improvement.
- Difficulty selection and changes are accessible and clearly indicated in the UI.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on difficulty selection, question success rates, and player progression to inform balancing and future improvements (with user consent and privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for difficulty selection and adaptive logic (e.g., failed updates, invalid states), with clear, user-friendly messages and options to retry or reset.
- Difficulty-related errors and unusual events are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
