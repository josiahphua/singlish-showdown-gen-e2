# User Story 5: Leaderboard and Competition (Further Improved)

## As a competitive player,
I want to see my score compared to others on a leaderboard,
So that I can challenge myself and friends and track my performance.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- A global leaderboard displays top scores from all players, with options for session-based and friend-group leaderboards.
- Players can enter a nickname to appear on the leaderboard; nicknames are moderated for appropriateness and privacy, and can be changed or anonymized.
- The leaderboard updates in real time and prevents duplicate or fraudulent entries (anti-cheat measures, e.g., rate limiting, validation).
- Players can opt out of public display and view their own ranking privately, with clear privacy controls.
- Leaderboard data is stored securely, encrypted at rest, and complies with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- The leaderboard UI is accessible, responsive, and provides filters (e.g., daily, weekly, all-time, friends).
- Players are notified of their ranking changes and achievements via in-game notifications.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on leaderboard participation, ranking changes, and achievement unlocks to inform future improvements (with user consent and privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for leaderboard actions (e.g., failed submissions, network errors, nickname conflicts), with clear, user-friendly messages and options to retry or recover.
- Leaderboard errors and unusual events are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
