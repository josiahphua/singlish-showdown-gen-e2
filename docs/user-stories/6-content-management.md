# User Story 6: Content Management (Further Improved)

## As a content manager,
I want to add, edit, or remove questions and audio clips easily through a secure admin interface,
So that the game content stays fresh, accurate, and relevant.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- An admin interface allows authorized users to update, add, or remove questions and audio clips, with batch editing and search/filter features.
- All content changes are versioned, with the ability to view history, compare versions, and roll back to previous versions.
- New questions and audio require review and approval before being published, with workflow status indicators.
- Outdated or incorrect content can be flagged by users or admins and removed or revised efficiently.
- Admin access is restricted by role-based permissions, requires secure authentication, and logs all actions for audit.
- The system supports previewing content as it will appear to players before publishing.
- The game collects anonymized analytics on content management actions (e.g., edits, approvals, rollbacks, flagged content) to improve admin workflows (with privacy compliance).
- Error handling is implemented for admin actions (e.g., failed saves, permission errors, version conflicts), with clear, user-friendly messages and options to retry or escalate.
- Admin errors and unusual events are logged for monitoring and debugging, without exposing sensitive user data.
