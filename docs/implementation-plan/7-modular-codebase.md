# Implementation Plan: Modular Codebase

## Overview
Establish a modular, maintainable codebase with clear boundaries, documentation, analytics, and error handling.

## Steps
1. **Project Structure**
   - Organize code by feature modules (quiz, audio, leaderboard, admin, etc.) with clear folder structure.
   - Document module boundaries, APIs, and dependencies.

2. **Module Development**
   - Develop each feature as a self-contained module with minimal cross-dependencies.
   - Use TypeScript interfaces/types for module APIs.
   - Enforce boundaries with linting/static analysis.

3. **Testing & CI**
   - Write unit and integration tests for all modules (90%+ coverage).
   - Set up CI to run tests and static analysis on every PR.

4. **Documentation**
   - Provide onboarding docs, module READMEs, and a changelog for major updates.

5. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules, with unified schema for cross-feature analysis.
   - Track anonymized module usage, feature adoption, and error rates.
   - Use analytics to inform refactoring and future development, and provide dashboards for all feature owners.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service for all modules, with shared error schema and integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry).
   - Implement error boundaries in React and robust error logging for all modules.
   - Provide clear, developer-friendly error messages and logs.

7. **Review & Refactor**
   - Regularly review module boundaries and refactor as needed for maintainability.
   - Ensure onboarding documentation and changelogs are updated with all cross-module integration points (analytics, error logging, admin roles, etc.).

## Technologies
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest/Playwright, Analytics/Logging Service

## Deliverables
- Modular, maintainable codebase with documentation, analytics, and robust error handling.
- Onboarding guide and changelog.
- Example integration points for analytics, error logging, and admin roles across all feature modules.
