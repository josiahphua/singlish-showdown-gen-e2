# Implementation Plan: Difficulty Levels

## Overview
Implement a flexible difficulty system for questions, with analytics, adaptive logic, and robust error handling.

## Steps
1. **Difficulty Tagging**
   - Define clear, shared criteria for easy, medium, and hard questions (vocabulary, context, etc.), referenced by quiz and analytics modules.
   - Tag all questions in the database by difficulty, using a unified schema.

2. **Difficulty Selection UI**
   - Allow players to select difficulty before starting a session, with descriptions for each level.
   - Clearly indicate current difficulty in the UI and allow changes if adaptive mode is enabled.

3. **Adaptive Difficulty**
   - Implement logic to increase/decrease difficulty based on player performance, with opt-out option.
   - Track and display performance by difficulty in progress history.

4. **Scoring & Rewards**
   - Scale scores and rewards based on difficulty, and explain this to players.

5. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized difficulty selection, question success rates, and player progression.
   - Use analytics to inform balancing and future improvements, with unified schema for cross-feature analysis.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Handle failed updates, invalid states, and adaptive logic errors with clear, user-friendly messages and options to retry or reset.
   - Log difficulty-related errors for monitoring/debugging, with shared error schema.

7. **Testing**
   - Test difficulty selection, adaptive logic, and scoring across all flows.

## Technologies
- React, Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, Analytics/Logging Service

## Deliverables
- Flexible, robust difficulty system with analytics and error handling.
- Documentation for difficulty criteria, adaptive logic, and scoring.
- Example integration points with quiz, progress tracking, analytics, and error logging modules.
