# Implementation Plan: Leaderboard and Competition

## Overview
Develop a secure, real-time leaderboard system supporting global, session, and friend-group rankings, with analytics and error handling.

## Steps
1. **Leaderboard Data Model**
   - Design a shared schema for scores, nicknames, timestamps, session/group IDs, and privacy settings, used across leaderboard and analytics modules.
   - Example (Prisma):
     ```prisma
     model LeaderboardEntry {
       id         String   @id @default(uuid())
       userId     String?
       nickname   String
       score      Int
       sessionId  String?
       groupId    String?
       privacy    String
       createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
     }
     ```
   - Store leaderboard data in a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis for real-time updates).

2. **Leaderboard API & Logic**
   - Implement endpoints for submitting scores, fetching rankings, and filtering (daily, weekly, all-time, friends).
     - `POST /api/leaderboard/submit` (body: { userId, nickname, score, sessionId, groupId })
     - `GET /api/leaderboard?filter=all-time|daily|friends`
   - Add anti-cheat measures (rate limiting, validation, duplicate detection).
   - Support nickname moderation and privacy controls (integrate with admin module).

3. **Frontend UI**
   - Build responsive, accessible leaderboard UI with filters and search.
   - Allow users to opt in/out of public display and view their own ranking privately.
   - Notify users of ranking changes and achievements.

4. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Use websockets or polling for real-time leaderboard updates.

5. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized leaderboard participation, ranking changes, and achievement unlocks.
   - Provide admin dashboard for analytics review, integrated with other modules.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Handle failed submissions, network errors, nickname conflicts, and privacy issues with clear messages and retry options.
   - Log leaderboard errors for monitoring/debugging, with shared error schema.

7. **Testing**
   - Test leaderboard flows, privacy controls, and anti-cheat logic.
   - Validate accessibility and responsiveness.

## Technologies
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis (optional), Tailwind CSS, Websockets, Analytics/Logging Service

## Deliverables
- Real-time, secure leaderboard system with privacy controls, analytics, and error handling.
- Documentation for leaderboard API (with endpoint signatures), data model, and user/admin flows.
- Example schemas and integration points with analytics, error logging, and admin modules.
