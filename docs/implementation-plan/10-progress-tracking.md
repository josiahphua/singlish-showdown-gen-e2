# Implementation Plan: Progress Tracking

## Overview
Build a robust progress tracking system for players, supporting local/cloud storage, analytics, and error handling.

## Steps
1. **Progress Data Model**
   - Define a shared schema for progress (answered questions, scores, streaks, timestamps, difficulty, etc.), referenced by quiz and analytics modules.
   - Store progress locally (browser storage) and/or in the cloud (user account), with privacy options.

2. **Progress Sync & Recovery**
   - Implement syncing across devices for logged-in users.
   - Support resuming, resetting, and exporting/deleting progress.
   - Handle incomplete sessions and unexpected disconnects gracefully.

3. **Progress UI**
   - Provide clear UI for reviewing past answers, explanations, and performance statistics (charts, streaks, etc.).
   - Prompt returning players to resume or start new sessions.

4. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized usage of progress tracking, session resumes, and data exports/deletions.
   - Use analytics to inform future improvements, with unified schema for cross-feature analysis.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Handle failed saves, sync errors, and data loss with clear, user-friendly messages and options to retry or recover.
   - Log progress tracking errors for monitoring/debugging, with shared error schema.

6. **Testing**
   - Test progress tracking, sync, and recovery across devices and browsers.

## Technologies
- React, Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, Local Storage, Analytics/Logging Service

## Deliverables
- Robust progress tracking system with analytics and error handling.
- Documentation for progress data model, sync, and privacy options.
- Example integration points with quiz, difficulty, analytics, and error logging modules.
