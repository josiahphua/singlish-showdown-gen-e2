# Implementation Plan: Audio Pronunciation

## Overview
Deliver high-quality, accessible audio pronunciation for Singlish questions, with robust analytics and error handling.

## Steps
1. **Audio Content Creation**
   - Record native speakers or use high-quality TTS for all relevant questions.
   - Review audio for clarity, authenticity, and cultural appropriateness.
   - Store audio files in a cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, GCP Storage) with public URLs.
   - Use a shared audio schema for all modules (see question pool in quiz gameplay plan).

2. **Data Model & Integration**
   - Extend shared question schema to include audio URL, transcript, and playback metadata.
   - Example (Prisma):
     ```prisma
     model Audio {
       id         String   @id @default(uuid())
       questionId String
       url        String
       transcript String
       duration   Int
       createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
     }
     ```
   - Link audio to questions in the database.

3. **Frontend Audio Player**
   - Implement accessible audio player (React component) with play/pause, replay, volume, and speed controls.
   - Provide visual feedback for playback state.
   - Display transcript and allow keyboard/screen reader access.
   - Integrate with quiz UI and analytics modules for usage tracking.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Detect and handle failed loads, unsupported formats, and playback errors.
   - Show user-friendly error messages and fallback options (e.g., transcript only).
   - Log audio errors for monitoring/debugging, with shared error schema.

5. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized usage: play count, speed changes, errors, transcript views.
   - Store analytics for admin review and accessibility improvement, with unified schema for cross-feature analysis.

6. **Testing**
   - Test audio playback on all supported browsers/devices.
   - Validate accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), including keyboard and screen reader support.
   - Test analytics and error logging integration.

## Technologies
- React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML5 Audio, Tailwind CSS, Cloud Storage, Analytics/Logging Service

## Deliverables
- Audio-enabled questions with accessible playback and robust error handling.
- Analytics dashboard for audio usage and issues.
- Documentation for audio integration, API endpoints, and accessibility.
- Example schemas and integration points with quiz, analytics, and error logging modules.
