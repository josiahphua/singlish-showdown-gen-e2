# Implementation Plan: Accessibility and Inclusivity

## Overview
Ensure the game is fully accessible and inclusive, meeting or exceeding WCAG 2.1 AA standards, with analytics and robust error handling.

## Steps
1. **Accessibility Audit & Design**
   - Audit all UI/UX for accessibility gaps (color contrast, font size, ARIA, navigation, etc.), referencing shared UI components.
   - Design for keyboard, screen reader, and prefers-reduced-motion support.
   - Support zoom, high-contrast, and dark mode.

2. **Implementation**
   - Use semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and accessible components throughout (shared with other modules).
   - Add transcripts and captions for all audio/video content (integrate with audio and quiz modules).
   - Ensure logical tab order and visible focus indicators.
   - Test with real users and automated tools (axe, Lighthouse).

3. **Accessibility Features**
   - Provide easy toggles for accessibility features (captions, high contrast, etc.).
   - Make explanations and glossaries easily accessible from all screens.

4. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized usage of accessibility features and navigation patterns.
   - Use analytics to inform future improvements, with unified schema for cross-feature analysis.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Handle accessibility feature failures (e.g., transcript load errors) with clear, user-friendly messages and fallback options.
   - Log accessibility-related errors for monitoring/debugging, with shared error schema.

6. **Testing**
   - Test all features with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and on various devices/browsers.
   - Validate compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA.

## Technologies
- React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, axe, Lighthouse, Analytics/Logging Service

## Deliverables
- Fully accessible game UI/UX with robust analytics and error handling.
- Documentation for accessibility features and compliance.
- Example integration points with UI, audio, analytics, and error logging modules.
