# Implementation Plan: Quiz Gameplay Experience

## Overview
Implement a robust, engaging quiz gameplay system for Singlish trivia, supporting both single-player and competitive modes, with analytics and error handling.

## Steps
1. **Question Pool & Data Model**
   - Design a shared schema for questions (id, text, options, answer, media, topic, difficulty, type, cultural note, etc.) used across quiz, audio, and admin modules.
   - Example (Prisma):
     ```prisma
     model Question {
       id           String   @id @default(uuid())
       text         String
       options      String[]
       answer       String
       media        Json?    // audio, image, context
       topic        String
       difficulty   String
       type         String
       culturalNote String?
       createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
       updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
     }
     ```
   - Store questions in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL via Prisma) with indexing for fast random selection and filtering.
   - Implement admin tools for question CRUD and tagging (see content management plan for shared admin roles and workflows).

2. **Quiz Engine**
   - Build a service to fetch randomized, non-repeating questions by session, topic, and difficulty.
   - API example:
     - `GET /api/quiz/session/:sessionId/questions?topic=...&difficulty=...`
     - `POST /api/quiz/session/:sessionId/answer` (body: { questionId, answer })
   - Support session state (active questions, answers, progress, streaks, timer, etc.) in backend (e.g., Redis or DB) and frontend (React context/state).
   - Implement logic for pausing/resuming, concurrent sessions, and session recovery after disconnects (integrate with progress tracking module).

3. **UI/UX**
   - Design accessible, responsive quiz screens with clear navigation, progress indicators, and controls.
   - Display questions, options, media, and timer; provide feedback after each answer.
   - Show summary screen with performance, correct/incorrect answers, and learning tips.

4. **Game Modes**
   - Implement single-player and competitive (timed/scored) modes, with clear instructions and UI differences.
   - Add support for joining/creating competitive sessions (e.g., via room code or matchmaking).

5. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized data: question difficulty, common mistakes, time per question, engagement, session outcomes.
   - Store analytics in a privacy-compliant database/table, with unified schema for cross-feature analysis.
   - Provide admin dashboard for analytics review (integrated with other modules).

6. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Handle network failures, invalid answers, session timeouts, and incomplete sessions gracefully.
   - Show user-friendly error messages and options to retry or recover.
   - Log errors and unusual events for monitoring/debugging (e.g., Sentry, custom logging service), with shared error schema.

7. **Testing**
   - Write unit, integration, and E2E tests for quiz logic, session management, and UI flows.
   - Test edge cases: disconnects, rapid answer changes, concurrent sessions, analytics and error logging integration, etc.

8. **Review & Launch**
   - Conduct accessibility and usability testing.
   - Review question/answer content for clarity and cultural sensitivity.
   - Launch MVP, monitor analytics, and iterate.

## Technologies
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis (optional), Tailwind CSS, Playwright/Vitest, Sentry (or similar)

## Deliverables
- Fully functional quiz gameplay system with analytics, error handling, and admin tools.
- Documentation for data model, API (with endpoint signatures), and user/admin flows.
- Example schemas and integration points with progress tracking, analytics, and error logging modules.
