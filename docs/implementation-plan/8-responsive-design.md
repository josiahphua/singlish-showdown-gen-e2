# Implementation Plan: Responsive Design

## Overview
Deliver a responsive, visually appealing UI that works seamlessly across all devices and browsers, with analytics and error handling.

## Steps
1. **Design System**
   - Define a shared design system for breakpoints, fluid layouts, and scalable assets for all screen sizes (min 320px width), used across all UI modules.
   - Support dark mode and system preferences.

2. **Implementation**
   - Use CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS) and media queries for responsive layouts.
   - Ensure all controls are touch- and mouse-friendly, with appropriate hit areas.
   - Avoid horizontal scrolling and ensure all content is accessible on small screens.

3. **Testing**
   - Test UI on major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and OS (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - Validate with device emulators and real devices.

4. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized device/browser usage, screen sizes, and layout issues.
   - Use analytics to inform responsive design improvements, with unified schema for cross-feature analysis.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Handle layout/rendering issues, unsupported browsers, and failed asset loads with clear, user-friendly messages and fallback options.
   - Log responsive design errors for monitoring/debugging, with shared error schema.

## Technologies
- React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Analytics/Logging Service

## Deliverables
- Fully responsive, accessible UI with analytics and robust error handling.
- Documentation for responsive design system and testing.
- Example integration points with UI, analytics, and error logging modules.
