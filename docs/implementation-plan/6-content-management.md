# Implementation Plan: Content Management

## Overview
Build a secure, versioned admin interface for managing questions and audio, with analytics and error handling.

## Steps
1. **Admin Roles & Permissions**
   - Define shared admin roles and permissions for content management, review, and moderation (see authenticity plan).
   - Implement secure authentication and role-based access control, unified across all admin modules.

2. **Admin Interface**
   - Build UI for batch editing, search/filter, preview, and CRUD operations on questions and audio.
   - Support versioning, history, and rollback for all content changes, with unified versioning schema.
   - Show workflow status (pending review, approved, flagged, etc.), integrated with review module.

3. **Content Review Integration**
   - Integrate review workflow for new/edited content (see authenticity plan).
   - Allow flagging and resolution of outdated/incorrect content.

4. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized admin actions (edits, approvals, rollbacks, flagged content).
   - Provide dashboard for workflow and content health, integrated with review and admin modules.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Handle failed saves, permission errors, version conflicts, and preview issues with clear messages and retry/escalation options.
   - Log admin errors for monitoring/debugging, with shared error schema.

6. **Testing**
   - Test all admin flows, permissions, and edge cases (e.g., simultaneous edits, rollbacks).

## Technologies

## Deliverables
- Secure, versioned admin interface for content management with analytics and error handling.
- Documentation for admin workflows, permissions, and versioning.
