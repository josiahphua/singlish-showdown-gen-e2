# Implementation Plan: Content Authenticity and Review

## Overview
Establish a robust review workflow for all game content to ensure cultural accuracy, clarity, and accountability.

## Steps
1. **Reviewer Roles & Permissions**
   - Define shared admin/reviewer roles (cultural consultant, admin, reviewer) used across all admin/content modules.
   - Implement secure authentication and role-based access control (see content management plan for unified admin system).

2. **Review Workflow**
   - Build an admin interface for reviewing, approving, flagging, and commenting on questions, answers, and audio (integrated with content management UI).
   - Track approval status, reviewer, timestamps, and comments for each item.
   - Support multiple reviewers and consensus/disagreement tracking.

3. **Content Logging & Versioning**
   - Log all changes, reviews, and reviewer comments for audit trails and version history.
   - Allow rollback to previous versions if needed.

4. **Flagging & Feedback**
   - Enable users and reviewers to flag content for review or revision.
   - Notify reviewers/admins of flagged items and track resolution.

5. **Analytics**
   - Use a shared analytics service for all modules (see modular codebase plan).
   - Track anonymized review times, flagged content, reviewer actions, and workflow bottlenecks.
   - Provide analytics dashboard for process improvement, integrated with admin dashboard.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Use a unified error logging service (see modular codebase plan) for all modules.
   - Handle failed submissions, permission errors, and workflow conflicts with clear messages and retry/escalation options.
   - Log review errors for monitoring/debugging, with shared error schema.

7. **Testing**
   - Test review flows, permissions, and edge cases (e.g., simultaneous edits, conflicting reviews).

## Technologies
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Auth Provider, Analytics/Logging Service

## Deliverables
- Admin review interface with full workflow, logging, and analytics.
- Documentation for review process, roles, and permissions.
- Example schemas and integration points with content management, analytics, and error logging modules.
